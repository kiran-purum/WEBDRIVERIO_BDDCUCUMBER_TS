<h1 align="center"> Hi!üëã WELCOME TO WEBDRIVERIO AUTOMATION TESTING PROJECT </h1>
<p align="left">

*Hello Everyone, In this project I used the BDDCUCUMBER as a framework and TYPESCRIPT as a language. Then, I tested the [Automation_Practice](http://automationpractice.com/index.php) for Creating an Account and filling the form with the user data and added one product to cart and tested all the webpages in the application like MyAccount, Products_section, Shopping_cart, Address_page, Shipping_item_details, Payments_page, Order_confirmation. Still testing more features and creating more test cases.*
